    <!-- React is a library and not a framework. 
    Framework comes with a lot of baggage with it, React doesn't need any of those. We can use the cdn links to get started with REACT.
    We can even use a small piece of REACT code with an application made with other language(jQuery).

    <div id="root">
        <!-- <h1>
            Hello World!
        </h1> -->
        <h1>WHat happens when the react root.render() is executed?</h1>
        <p>Once the root.render() is executed the previous html code inside of the div(with id="root") will be replaced by the new code.</p>

    <!-- All the changes are made only to the root div since we are only applying render withing that block of html.
    So React is a library of JS which along with building large scale applications can also help make changes to exixting project,
    by only modifying a small part of the application. We can use the cdn links to make react work.
